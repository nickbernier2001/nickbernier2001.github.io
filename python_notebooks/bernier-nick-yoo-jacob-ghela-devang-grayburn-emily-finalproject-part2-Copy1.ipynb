    "At first glance without a selection, the user is presented with two graphs: a scatter plot that shows the per capita income of each neighborhood in Chicago and a bar chart that shows each community area and their \"hardship index\". The first chart has a degrading color scheme where the points with less opacity have a lower per capita income and the points with more opacity have a higher per capita income. The second chart uses a hardship index, which is an intersectional point that describes the \"hardship\" of a certain community. Some of the data included in this hardship index are poverty, per capita income, education and crowded housing. With the interaction between the two visualizations, one could click and drag to select data points and those data points would be represented in the graph below. This is useful because a user would be able to see the difference in hardship between two or more communities and make inferences based on their per capita income. This interactive visualization also changes with the data points that are selected which could further engage the audience and display the data more accurately. While selecting the data points, the audience can only see the data points that are being selected at given point. With this, this shows a strong comparison between the different types of per capita and hardhsip index.\n",
